Storytelling Code Based access for Django
============

Simple Django app I've created to handle a code based login system. Originally, the point of this system was to send out codes to users and let them access the content through the code.


Requirements
------

The requirements are inside requirements.txt, so don't forget to install those. They are: 

  - Django 1.7
  - django-bootstrap
  - pytz
